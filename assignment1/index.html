        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
        with the experience?
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Immediately upon opening the page, I was confronted by the bombardment
        of saturated colours clashing with each other. My first thought was
        how unconventional the website appeared, as it broke many graphic and
        web design rules and traditions. The first page I was met with looked
        more like a poorly designed poster than a webpage, using inharmonious
        colours, unpopular fonts such as ‘Comics Sans’, and a lack of
        professional polish. However, this choice makes it stand out against
        the sea of generic portfolio websites. The interactive cursor element
        which changed the colours and altered the text showed the designer’s
        competency, and gave me an component to be engaged with and interested
        in. The overall first impression I had from this front page was that
        the designer was an avant-garde artist who was passionate about
        breaking convention and expressing themselves.

        2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The website has four main segments to it, each with their own unique
        art direction and interactive element.
        <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Artist Statement </h4>
          The first segment is an artist statement which as an interactive element in the
          form of splitting the background of the page into four distinct
          colours, with its centre following the cursor. I spent time
          experimenting with how the colours affected the paragraph of text, and
          discovered how some words of the statement changed based on what
          colour was behind it. I investigated all of the possible combinations
          of words and how this changed the meaning of their statement. I
          experimented with blending different words together, attempting to
          break the experience and see it in unintended modes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <h4>Animated Element</h4> Below the artist statement was a triangle in the middle of the
          page with the text, “div center Perfectly”, and no other elements. As
          I knew from the front page that the website was interactive, I tried
          hovering over the triangle, which triggered it to rotate. The triangle
          would return to its default state when I hovered off, so I repeatedly
          hovered on and off the triangle to whimsically engage with it.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <h4>Pixel Displacement Effect</h4> The next segment prominently featured a mosaic of
          a mountain in the middle of the page. As I scrolled to it, my cursor
          was in the middle of the page from interacting with the triangle,
          placing it on the mosaic and cause it to displace around the cursor.
          This taught me what the interactive feature of this segment was. I
          played around with the pixel displacement, swiping the cursor back and
          forth at different speeds, watching the physics of the pixels as they
          moved across the screen.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <h4>Contact Details</h4> The final segment of the page featured lines of big text which rearranged themselves
          or moved as the mouse hovered over it. I sequentially hovered over each line of text to see what kind of
          unique animation would play. I wrongfully expected that clicking on the text would redirect me to another
          page, as typical of other webpages. I avoided clicking on the “Email”, “Line” and “LinkedIn” text because I
          knew they would most likely redirect me to those respective external pages.

        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        I spent the most time engaging with the pixel displacement effect
        segment of the website, as it was the most unique and novel part of
        the website. The interactivity of the element provided entertainment
        as the way the pixels responded to the movement of the cursor was
        extremely satisfying. It was also the most dynamic element of the
        website. Whilst most of the interactive elements on the site merely
        featured a toggle state with a predictable outcome, this mosaic effect
        had more room for experimentation.

        4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The most common action I performed was swiping the cursor across elements on the screen, as much of the
        interactivity of the website was triggered with contact with the cursor. I did not merely hover over the
        elements with the cursor, as I also wanted to watch the transitional animation between the different modes, and
        play around with how it moved if I interacted with it in a chaotic way. The amount of different interactive
        elements also prompted me to constantly shift between them.

        5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The goal of the interactive experience seems to be to appeal to clients that need front-end website design
        through showcasing their abilities to create engaging and aesthetically pleasing and unique web experiences by
        creating an impressive and engaging experience for the client upon interacting with the webpage. I believe that
        the client succeeds in this goal, as they effectively display their skill in web design and their unique
        artistic voice, which would appeal to clients looking for web designers.

      <h3>
        6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The experience communicates this goal by directly making their portfolio website into an example of what their
        work could be like for the client, integrating fun and unique interactive elements into the webpage. The
        designer lets the work speak for itself, showcasing their expertise by implementing high quality novel
        interactive elements into the website. It is clear that the designer is looking for work, as the website begins
        with an artist statement, and ends with contact information. These segments themselves also include quirky
        interactive elements which further reinforces their competency and personality.

        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many
        different times)
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The website is likely meant to be interacted with once in a short amount of time, as there are very few segments
        to the website. The showcases of their work are quick and simple experiences that can pique interest for a short
        span before the user moves on to the next segment. There is little text or extensive information or collections,
        there is little reason to stay for an extended period of time.

      <h3>
        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Typically, portfolio websites include an extensive collection of work sorted into different categories and
        webpages, prompting the user to spend their time to explore, however, this website is extremely simplified. All
        of the segments of the website are presented on a single page, streamlining the experience and communicating it
        to be a single visit experience. The segments are simple to navigate through, and can also be easily scrolled
        past. The lack of portfolio work or a collection, and the simplicity of the existing elements on the website
        does not encourage recurring visits to the website. The webpage ends in the contact information of the designer,
        serving as a call to action for the viewer and possible clients, and marks the end of the experience and the
        goal of the website.

      <h3>
        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Each of the segments makes subtle references to different media. The first segment, the artist statement, has a
        very graphic direction reminiscent of primitive digital communication design, or amateur digital design. The
        second segment directly makes an ironic meta reference towards web design, with a perfectly centred div labelled
        “Perfectly center div”. The pixel displacement effect segment is reminiscent of tiled mosaics, or LED displays.

      <h3>
        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research
        experience?
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The singularity of each segment suggests that each segment should be engaged as their own piece. Rather than
        quickly dismissing and scrolling past the segment, the user is encouraged to stop and engage with the segment
        and explore what it has to offer. This mimics a portfolio collection with different pieces of experiences.

      <h3>
        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research
        experience?
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The variety of the different media referenced displays the personality of the designer. The idiosyncrasy of each
        segment shows the passion the web designer has for design, as well as the breadth of their skills, as they are
        not funelled into one look. Additionally, the unique style of each segment creates dynamism and interest for the
        user.

        12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Nothing about the experience was frustrating, as the website was efficiently streamlined and the simplicity of
        the experience allowed eliminated additional points of error. The closest thing to frustration was how sometimes
        the pixel displacement effect would mistakenly think the cursor was hovering over it when that segment was half
        off the screen. This did not frustrate me, but it was the only noticeable mistake in the experience and took me
        out of it slightly.

      <h3>
        13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        The most satisfying part of the interaction was the discovery of the unique highlight text. On the site,
        highlighted text rotates through the colours of the rainbow, creating an aesthetically pleasing visual element.
        This design feature was discovered on accident went interacting with other parts of the experience, and created
        a pleasant surprise and a sense of accomplishment upon the finding. Additionally, I had never encountered this
        feature on any other website previously, so the novelty of the feature was elevated.
